1
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,417
We come in peace for cats 
and mice everywhere.

2
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:14,729
Hey, how you doing? Good to see you.
Thanks for coming out.

3
00:01:23,487 --> 00:01:26,531
Itchy ... Itchy ...

4
00:02:06,663 --> 00:02:07,914
Boring!

5
00:02:08,113 --> 00:02:10,198
Dad, we can't see the movie.

6
00:02:10,415 --> 00:02:14,377
I can't believe we're paying to see
something we get on TV for free.

7
00:02:14,584 --> 00:02:18,337
If you ask me, everybody in 
this theater is a giant sucker.

8
00:02:18,626 --> 00:02:21,337
Especially you.

9
00:02:21,331 --> 00:02:22,040
Especially you.

10
00:02:25,219 --> 00:02:27,555
Movie on the big screen!

11
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:03,170
Excuse me. My heinie is dipping.

12
00:03:18,853 --> 00:03:20,897
All right, well,
thanks a lot for coming.

13
00:03:21,107 --> 00:03:23,526
We've been playing
for three and a half hours.

14
00:03:23,735 --> 00:03:28,073
Now we'd like just a minute of your time
to say something about the environment.

15
00:03:31,785 --> 00:03:34,079
- You suck!
- Shut up and play!

16
00:03:34,287 --> 00:03:36,748
- Preachy!
- We're not being preachy.

17
00:03:36,957 --> 00:03:41,169
But the pollution in your lake,
it's dissolving our barge.

18
00:03:43,546 --> 00:03:45,465
I thought they touched on
a vital issue.

19
00:03:45,674 --> 00:03:47,634
I beg to differ.

20
00:03:52,389 --> 00:03:55,892
Gentlemen, it's been an honor
playing with you tonight.

21
00:04:17,664 --> 00:04:20,792
For the latest rock band
to die in our town ...

22
00:04:21,001 --> 00:04:23,044
Lord, hear our prayer.

23
00:04:23,461 --> 00:04:25,880
Lord, hear our prayer.

24
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:28,049
I hate being late.

25
00:04:28,258 --> 00:04:29,384
Well, I hate going.

26
00:04:29,593 --> 00:04:31,636
Why can't I worship the Lord
in my own way ...

27
00:04:31,845 --> 00:04:33,638
by praying like hell on my deathbed?

28
00:04:33,847 --> 00:04:35,557
Homer, they can hear you inside.

29
00:04:35,765 --> 00:04:41,104
Relax. Those pious morons are too busy
talking to their phony-baloney God.

30
00:04:44,274 --> 00:04:47,068
How you doing? Peace be with you.
Praise Jebus.

31
00:04:58,371 --> 00:05:00,832
Today I'd like to try something
a little different.

32
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:03,293
I'm going to call on one of you!

33
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,422
Now, the word of God
dwells within everyone.

34
00:05:07,631 --> 00:05:12,052
I want you to let that word out.
Let your spirit ...

35
00:05:12,552 --> 00:05:13,678
What is it, Ned?

36
00:05:13,887 --> 00:05:16,348
The good Lord is telling me
to confess to something.

37
00:05:16,556 --> 00:05:18,558
Gay, gay, gay.

38
00:05:18,767 --> 00:05:21,895
An immodest sense of pride
in our community.

39
00:05:22,646 --> 00:05:23,939
Somebody else?

40
00:05:24,397 --> 00:05:28,360
Let the Lord's light shine upon you.

41
00:05:32,239 --> 00:05:34,658
Feel the spirit.

42
00:05:35,408 --> 00:05:37,035
Let it out!

43
00:05:37,244 --> 00:05:40,538
Horrible, horrible things
are going to happen!

44
00:05:41,414 --> 00:05:45,126
And they're gonna happen to you!
And you! And you! And you.

45
00:05:45,335 --> 00:05:46,753
Whoa, nelly!

46
00:05:51,299 --> 00:05:54,302
People of Springfield,
heed this warning:

47
00:05:54,511 --> 00:05:55,720
Twisted tail!

48
00:05:55,929 --> 00:05:57,180
A thousand eyes!

49
00:05:57,389 --> 00:05:59,641
Trapped forever!

50
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:04,771
Dad, do something!

51
00:06:06,189 --> 00:06:07,816
This book doesn't have any answers!

52
00:06:08,024 --> 00:06:10,527
Beware! Beware! Time is short!

53
00:06:14,948 --> 00:06:17,659
Believe me! Believe me!

54
00:06:24,624 --> 00:06:26,668
Thanks for listening.

55
00:06:31,339 --> 00:06:33,091
Okay, who wants waffles?

56
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,426
I do, I do, I do!

57
00:06:34,634 --> 00:06:36,136
Wait a minute. What about Grampa?

58
00:06:36,344 --> 00:06:37,929
- I want syrup!
- I want strawberries!

59
00:06:38,138 --> 00:06:39,806
Something happened to that man.

60
00:06:40,015 --> 00:06:44,686
I'll tell you what happened to him.
A certain someone had a senior moment.

61
00:06:44,894 --> 00:06:50,734
But that's okay, because we love him
and we got a free rug out of it.

62
00:06:50,984 --> 00:06:53,403
What is the point of going 
to church every Sunday ...

63
00:06:53,612 --> 00:06:57,866
when if someone we love has a genuine
religious experience, we ignore it?

64
00:06:58,074 --> 00:06:59,868
Right, Grampa?

65
00:07:00,076 --> 00:07:02,245
I want bananas on my waffles.

66
00:07:02,454 --> 00:07:04,164
I rest my case.

67
00:07:05,415 --> 00:07:07,709
I'm not dropping this.

68
00:07:12,297 --> 00:07:14,841
Wait a minute. 
I'm still in the car.

69
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:16,968
Oh, right.

70
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:24,184
"Take out hornets' nest."

71
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:32,859
Check. "Fix sinkhole."

72
00:07:41,493 --> 00:07:42,953
Check.

73
00:07:43,161 --> 00:07:44,955
"Re-shingle roof"?

74
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:50,001
Steady.

75
00:07:51,503 --> 00:07:54,130
Steady.

76
00:07:58,843 --> 00:08:00,262
Why, you little ...!

77
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:04,808
I'll teach you to laugh
at something that's funny!

78
00:08:05,016 --> 00:08:08,019
You know, we are on the roof.
We could have some fun.

79
00:08:08,353 --> 00:08:10,063
What kind of fun?

80
00:08:10,272 --> 00:08:11,648
How about a dare contest?

81
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:15,026
That sounds fun. 
I dare you to ...

82
00:08:15,235 --> 00:08:16,778
climb the TV antenna!

83
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:21,283
- Piece of cake.
- Earthquake!

84
00:08:28,039 --> 00:08:29,958
Aftershock!

85
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:34,879
Homer, I don't mean
to be a Nervous Pervis ...

86
00:08:35,088 --> 00:08:38,925
but if he falls, couldn't that
make your boy a paraplege-arino?

87
00:08:39,342 --> 00:08:40,677
Shut up, Flanders.

88
00:08:40,885 --> 00:08:43,597
- Yeah, shut up, Flanders.
- Well said, boy.

89
00:08:45,557 --> 00:08:47,601
Steady. Steady.

90
00:08:47,809 --> 00:08:48,935
Steady ...

91
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,818
Hello. Sorry to bother you
on a Sunday ...

92
00:08:57,027 --> 00:09:02,073
but I'm sure you're as worried about the 
pollution in Lake Springfield as I am.

93
00:09:07,412 --> 00:09:11,666
Lake Springfield has higher levels
of mercury than ev ...

94
00:09:18,256 --> 00:09:21,718
Why, it's the little girl
who saved my cat.

95
00:09:21,927 --> 00:09:23,345
Lake Springfield is ...

96
00:09:34,439 --> 00:09:36,107
Come on over, Lisa.

97
00:09:36,316 --> 00:09:39,194
You can canvass me
as long as you want.

98
00:09:39,402 --> 00:09:41,905
Milhouse, you don't care
about the environment.

99
00:09:42,113 --> 00:09:44,783
Hey. I am very passionate
about the planet.

100
00:09:44,991 --> 00:09:46,284
Say global warming is a myth.

101
00:09:46,493 --> 00:09:49,913
It's a myth! 
Further study is needed!

102
00:09:50,121 --> 00:09:53,250
That's for selling out your beliefs.

103
00:09:54,876 --> 00:09:56,419
Oh, poor Milhouse.

104
00:09:57,295 --> 00:09:59,297
Dream coming true.

105
00:09:59,506 --> 00:10:02,008
Are you aware that a leaky faucet
can waste over ...?

106
00:10:02,217 --> 00:10:03,677
Two thousand gallons a year.

107
00:10:03,885 --> 00:10:06,596
- Turning off lights can save ...
- Enough energy to power Pittsburgh.

108
00:10:06,805 --> 00:10:08,974
And if we kept our thermostats
at 68 in winter ...

109
00:10:09,182 --> 00:10:12,310
We'd be free from our dependency
on foreign oil in 17 years.

110
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:14,020
I'm Colin.

111
00:10:14,229 --> 00:10:15,855
I haven't seen you at school.

112
00:10:16,064 --> 00:10:17,941
Moved from Ireland.
My dad's a musician.

113
00:10:18,149 --> 00:10:19,734
- Is he ...?
- He's not Bono.

114
00:10:19,943 --> 00:10:23,363
- I just thought, 
because you're Irish and ...
- He's not Bono.

115
00:10:23,989 --> 00:10:24,990
Do you play?

116
00:10:25,198 --> 00:10:27,242
Just piano, guitar, trumpet,
drums and bass.

117
00:10:27,659 --> 00:10:31,913
He's pure gold.
For once in your life, be cool.

118
00:10:32,122 --> 00:10:35,250
So is your name as pretty
as your face?

119
00:10:39,296 --> 00:10:41,047
You okay there?

120
00:10:43,883 --> 00:10:48,096
Twisted tail! A thousand eyes!
Trapped forever!

121
00:10:49,598 --> 00:10:51,349
What could that be?

122
00:10:51,558 --> 00:10:53,852
I believe it's the sound
the Green Lantern made ...

123
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:57,105
when Sinestro threw him
into a vat of acid.

124
00:10:59,274 --> 00:11:02,611
Yeah. Thanks for coming over.

125
00:11:02,819 --> 00:11:04,988
Thanks for giving me
your pregnancy pants.

126
00:11:05,196 --> 00:11:07,574
Never known comfort like this.

127
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:13,455
Why did I suggest this?

128
00:11:24,424 --> 00:11:26,760
All right, boy,
time for the ultimate dare.

129
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:33,475
I dare you to skateboard
to Krusty Burger and back ...

130
00:11:33,683 --> 00:11:35,518
naked.

131
00:11:35,894 --> 00:11:37,646
- How naked?
- Fourth base.

132
00:11:37,854 --> 00:11:39,022
Girls might see my doodle.

133
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:44,194
Oh, I see. Then I hereby
declare you chicken for life.

134
00:11:44,402 --> 00:11:48,365
Every morning, you'll wake up to
"Good morning, chicken".

135
00:11:48,573 --> 00:11:50,367
At your wedding, I'll sing:

136
00:12:04,756 --> 00:12:06,633
I like men now.

137
00:12:07,384 --> 00:12:08,969
Don't look where I'm pointing!

138
00:12:28,405 --> 00:12:31,575
Stop in the name of
American squeamishness!

139
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:44,212
Boys, before we eat, don't forget to 
thank the Lord for this bountiful ...

140
00:12:44,421 --> 00:12:45,422
Penis?!

141
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:47,591
- Bountiful penis.
- Bountiful penis.

142
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:48,925
Amen.

143
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:54,055
Listen, kid, nobody likes wearing clothes
in public, but, you know, it's the law.

144
00:12:58,435 --> 00:13:00,270
Lunchtime!

145
00:13:00,478 --> 00:13:02,272
You can't just leave me out here.

146
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,900
Don't worry, we found
a friend for you to play with.

147
00:13:14,492 --> 00:13:17,579
Nelson, honey, where have you been?

148
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,753
- Dad!
- What seems to be the problem, officers?

149
00:13:24,961 --> 00:13:26,796
Tell him you dared me to do it.

150
00:13:27,005 --> 00:13:31,760
If that's true, then you should be
taking the rap here, not your son.

151
00:13:33,261 --> 00:13:36,640
And what happens to me
if it's my fault?

152
00:13:36,848 --> 00:13:39,643
You'll have to attend
a one-hour parenting class.

153
00:13:39,851 --> 00:13:42,437
It was all his idea!
He's out of control, I tell you!

154
00:13:42,646 --> 00:13:43,855
I'm at my wits' end.

155
00:13:44,481 --> 00:13:46,232
It's so ...

156
00:13:47,734 --> 00:13:49,611
See you in court, kid.

157
00:13:49,819 --> 00:13:51,947
Okay, son, let's get some lunch.

158
00:13:52,155 --> 00:13:53,823
Did you at least bring my clothes?

159
00:13:54,157 --> 00:13:55,951
Shirt, socks, everything you need.

160
00:13:56,159 --> 00:13:59,788
- You didn't bring my pants.
- Who am I, Tommy Bahama?

161
00:14:00,038 --> 00:14:01,790
This is the worst day of my life.

162
00:14:01,998 --> 00:14:05,043
The worst day of your life so far.

163
00:14:08,755 --> 00:14:11,299
- Say, Bart?
- What do you want, Flanders?

164
00:14:11,508 --> 00:14:14,219
If you need pants,
I carry an extra pair.

165
00:14:14,427 --> 00:14:17,138
You know how boys are,
always praying through the knees.

166
00:14:17,347 --> 00:14:19,599
Why are you helping me?
I'm not your kid.

167
00:14:19,808 --> 00:14:23,770
We're neighbors. I'm sure your father
would do the same for my boys.

168
00:14:23,979 --> 00:14:25,397
Thank you.

169
00:14:32,821 --> 00:14:35,448
- Hey, what's with you?
- You really wanna know?

170
00:14:35,657 --> 00:14:36,992
Of course I do.

171
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,661
What kind of a father
wouldn't care about ...?

172
00:14:39,869 --> 00:14:41,079
A pig wearing a hat!

173
00:14:42,372 --> 00:14:43,456
Action.

174
00:14:43,999 --> 00:14:48,628
Hey, hey! It's your old pal Krusty,
for my new pork sandwich, the Klogger.

175
00:14:48,837 --> 00:14:53,758
If you can find a greasier sandwich,
you're in Mexico!

176
00:14:57,846 --> 00:15:00,181
And we're clear.

177
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:02,267
Perfect. Cut, print, kill the pig.

178
00:15:04,394 --> 00:15:07,439
What ...?! You can't kill him
if he's wearing people clothes!

179
00:15:21,119 --> 00:15:23,496
You're coming home with me.

180
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:30,086
"A thousand eyes."
What could that be?

181
00:15:31,212 --> 00:15:35,091
I'm pretty sure
a thousand is a number.

182
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:40,055
Hey, Marge. Isn't it great being married
to someone who's recklessly impulsive?

183
00:15:40,263 --> 00:15:42,265
Actually, it's aged me horribly.

184
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:45,393
Then say hello
to the newest Simpson.

185
00:15:51,524 --> 00:15:52,943
Homer!

186
00:15:54,611 --> 00:15:59,282
I believe what happened in church
was a warning about precisely this.

187
00:15:59,491 --> 00:16:01,534
Please, get rid of that pig.

188
00:16:01,743 --> 00:16:06,706
Oh, you're gonna love him.
Look, he does an impression of you.

189
00:16:09,292 --> 00:16:11,419
You nailed her.

190
00:16:11,628 --> 00:16:14,547
He also does me.

191
00:16:15,298 --> 00:16:17,759
You smiled. I'm off the hook.

192
00:16:26,476 --> 00:16:29,854
Oh, you have so many looks.

193
00:16:46,997 --> 00:16:48,790
So that's what snug is.

194
00:16:48,999 --> 00:16:51,251
Who's a good pig?

195
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,129
Who's a good pig?

196
00:16:57,757 --> 00:16:59,884
Rough day, huh, son?

197
00:17:00,594 --> 00:17:03,471
You don't know what rough is, sister.

198
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,766
Bart, you know, whenever my boys
bake up a batch of frownies ...

199
00:17:06,975 --> 00:17:08,310
I take them fishing.

200
00:17:08,518 --> 00:17:10,687
Does your dad ever take you fishing?

201
00:17:13,857 --> 00:17:17,444
Dad, it's not fair to use a 
bug zapper to catch the fish.

202
00:17:17,652 --> 00:17:21,156
If you love fish like I do,
you want them to die with dignity.

203
00:17:26,661 --> 00:17:29,414
I think I have a nibble.

204
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:39,674
I think fishing might be
more fun with you.

205
00:17:39,883 --> 00:17:42,677
Oh, great. Now, how about
I fix you some cocoa?

206
00:17:42,886 --> 00:17:44,763
No way. Cocoa's for wusses.

207
00:17:44,971 --> 00:17:47,849
Well, sir, if you change your 
mind, it's on the windowsill.

208
00:18:08,161 --> 00:18:09,621
Oh, my God.

209
00:18:11,373 --> 00:18:14,459
Oh, wait. I didn't tell you the 
best part. He loves the environment.

210
00:18:14,668 --> 00:18:19,256
Oh, wait! I still didn't tell you the 
best part. He's got an Irish brogue.

211
00:18:19,464 --> 00:18:22,050
No, no, wait!
I still didn't tell you the best part.

212
00:18:22,259 --> 00:18:24,052
He's not imaginary!

213
00:18:24,261 --> 00:18:26,263
Oh, honey, that's great.

214
00:18:26,471 --> 00:18:30,350
But the very best thing
is that he listens to you.

215
00:18:30,558 --> 00:18:33,853
Because nothing means more
than for a man to ...

216
00:18:34,062 --> 00:18:36,856
How did the pig tracks
get on the ceiling?

217
00:18:37,065 --> 00:18:39,234
Spider-Pig, Spider-Pig

218
00:18:39,442 --> 00:18:41,903
Does whatever a Spider-Pig does

219
00:18:42,112 --> 00:18:44,364
Can he swing from a web?

220
00:18:44,573 --> 00:18:46,616
No, he can 't, he's a pig

221
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:50,704
Look out
He is the Spider-Pig

222
00:18:55,709 --> 00:18:57,168
Are we having fun yet?

223
00:18:57,377 --> 00:18:59,129
We are now. You've got a bite.

224
00:18:59,337 --> 00:19:01,673
Whoa, mama!

225
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:04,593
Oh, no, my good pole!

226
00:19:09,306 --> 00:19:10,932
You're not strangling me.

227
00:19:11,141 --> 00:19:13,560
What the ...?
Strangling's only good for ...

228
00:19:14,269 --> 00:19:15,895
Well, it's not good for anything.

229
00:19:16,104 --> 00:19:18,148
The only time you should
lay hands on a boy ...

230
00:19:18,356 --> 00:19:20,191
is to give him
a good pat on the back.

231
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,319
Hey, what the hell are you ...?

232
00:19:26,281 --> 00:19:27,949
One more time.

233
00:19:41,671 --> 00:19:43,924
Honey, I'm home.

234
00:19:49,471 --> 00:19:51,556
We are at the tipping point, people.

235
00:19:51,765 --> 00:19:53,558
If we don't do something now ...

236
00:19:55,352 --> 00:19:58,813
I'm sorry, I lost my train of thought.
Isn't he dreamy?

237
00:19:59,022 --> 00:20:00,148
Agreed.

238
00:20:00,357 --> 00:20:01,858
Okay, so here's the bottom line:

239
00:20:02,067 --> 00:20:04,152
If we don't change our ways
right now ...

240
00:20:04,361 --> 00:20:08,156
pollution in Lake Springfield
will be at this level.

241
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:10,408
That's not so bad.

242
00:20:10,617 --> 00:20:13,495
No, the lift is stuck.

243
00:20:19,626 --> 00:20:21,920
Am I getting through to anyone?

244
00:20:22,128 --> 00:20:24,673
Hell, yeah.
We need a new one of those things.

245
00:20:24,881 --> 00:20:27,175
All in favor of a new scissor lift,
say "aye".

246
00:20:27,384 --> 00:20:29,135
- Aye.
- No!

247
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:34,391
This lake is just one piece of trash
away from a toxic nightmare.

248
00:20:34,599 --> 00:20:36,017
But I knew you wouldn't listen.

249
00:20:36,226 --> 00:20:40,021
So I took the liberty of pouring water
from the lake in all your drinking glasses.

250
00:20:42,023 --> 00:20:44,109
This is why we should hate kids.

251
00:20:44,317 --> 00:20:45,777
This is serious, people.

252
00:20:45,986 --> 00:20:50,365
No more dumping in the lake.
I hereby declare a state of emergency.

253
00:20:50,574 --> 00:20:51,908
Code black.

254
00:20:53,034 --> 00:20:56,788
Black? That's the worst color there is.

255
00:20:56,997 --> 00:20:59,749
- No offense there, Carl.
- I get it all the time.

256
00:21:16,975 --> 00:21:19,477
Sorry, sorry. 
No dumping in the lake.

257
00:21:19,686 --> 00:21:25,525
Fine. I will put my yard trimmings
in a car compactor.

258
00:21:26,693 --> 00:21:28,862
Chief, I think there was
a dead body in there.

259
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:32,324
I thought that too,
until he said "yard trimmings".

260
00:21:32,532 --> 00:21:34,242
You gotta learn to listen, Lou.

261
00:21:34,451 --> 00:21:38,788
Let us now make sure this 
barrier is completely idiot-proof.

262
00:21:38,997 --> 00:21:40,999
- Cletus.
- Yessum?

263
00:21:41,207 --> 00:21:43,251
Try to dump something in the lake.

264
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:45,170
Okay.

265
00:21:53,219 --> 00:21:55,972
I can't. I simply can't.

266
00:21:56,181 --> 00:21:57,766
- Brilliant.
- Very effective.

267
00:22:09,819 --> 00:22:12,405
Don't get any ideas.

268
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:19,829
Maybe we should kiss,
just to break the tension.

269
00:22:20,038 --> 00:22:21,957
What's going on here?

270
00:22:22,165 --> 00:22:23,250
Nothing. Nothing.

271
00:22:23,458 --> 00:22:25,794
I'm not sure that pig
should be in the house.

272
00:22:26,002 --> 00:22:30,006
And by the way, what are 
you doing with his leavings?

273
00:22:30,215 --> 00:22:34,010
Don't worry.
I've devised a most elegant solution.

274
00:22:36,179 --> 00:22:37,681
It's leaking.

275
00:22:37,889 --> 00:22:41,434
It's not leaking, it's overflowing.

276
00:22:41,643 --> 00:22:45,605
He filled up the whole silo
in just two days?

277
00:22:45,814 --> 00:22:46,815
Well, I helped.

278
00:22:47,023 --> 00:22:52,320
Homer, stop! Stop. I know it's easy
for your mind to wander ...

279
00:22:54,155 --> 00:22:58,326
but I want you to
really concentrate on me.

280
00:23:00,537 --> 00:23:05,417
I can't escape the feeling that this
is the crisis Grampa warned us about.

281
00:23:05,625 --> 00:23:08,795
You have to dispose
of that waste properly.

282
00:23:09,379 --> 00:23:11,339
Okay, Marge. I will.

283
00:23:11,548 --> 00:23:13,466
You can take Spider-Pig with you.

284
00:23:13,675 --> 00:23:17,012
He's not Spider-Pig anymore,
he's Harry Plopper.

285
00:23:30,775 --> 00:23:31,776
Hello.

286
00:23:31,985 --> 00:23:33,361
Homer, you gotta get over here.

287
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:37,198
Health inspector shut down the doughnut
store, they're giving out free doughnuts!

288
00:23:37,407 --> 00:23:40,368
Oh, my God, oh, my God!
I just got one thing I gotta do first.

289
00:23:40,577 --> 00:23:44,039
Well, you better hurry.
They're going fast.

290
00:23:44,873 --> 00:23:46,875
Whoa, that was close.

291
00:24:27,958 --> 00:24:30,543
Evil!

292
00:24:32,212 --> 00:24:34,256
Drive, drive, drive!

293
00:24:34,714 --> 00:24:36,341
Oh, right.

294
00:25:02,826 --> 00:25:06,162
Look at that. You can see the four 
states that border Springfield:

295
00:25:06,371 --> 00:25:10,041
Ohio, Nevada, Maine and Kentucky.

296
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,585
Oh, yeah.

297
00:25:11,793 --> 00:25:15,130
And if you look real close,
you can almost ...

298
00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:20,969
Well, this certainly seems odd ...

299
00:25:21,177 --> 00:25:24,889
but who am I to question
the work of the Almighty?

300
00:25:25,974 --> 00:25:30,228
We thank you, Lord, for this 
mighty fine intelligent design.

301
00:25:30,437 --> 00:25:32,314
Good job.

302
00:25:33,023 --> 00:25:35,233
Jabbity, jabbity, jab, jab, jab!

303
00:25:35,442 --> 00:25:37,611
Hey! Jab one more eye
and it's a federal crime.

304
00:25:38,862 --> 00:25:41,615
- Who are you?
- Environmental Protection Agency.

305
00:25:49,956 --> 00:25:53,001
Russ Cargill, head of the EPA,
here to see the president.

306
00:25:58,632 --> 00:25:59,758
Mr. President.

307
00:26:01,217 --> 00:26:02,427
Ja, that is me.

308
00:26:02,636 --> 00:26:06,306
Pollution in Springfield
has reached crisis levels.

309
00:26:07,307 --> 00:26:11,353
I hate this job. Everything's "crisis" 
this and "end of the world" that.

310
00:26:11,561 --> 00:26:14,397
Nobody opens with a joke.
I miss Danny De Vito.

311
00:26:14,606 --> 00:26:18,276
You want a joke, huh?
Stop me if you've heard this one.

312
00:26:19,486 --> 00:26:22,489
Look at those angry eyes
and giant teeth.

313
00:26:22,697 --> 00:26:24,658
It's like Christmas
at the Kennedy compound.

314
00:26:25,075 --> 00:26:27,953
You know, sir, when you
made me head of the EPA ...

315
00:26:28,161 --> 00:26:31,539
you appointed one of the most 
successful men in America ...

316
00:26:31,748 --> 00:26:33,917
to the least successful agency
in government.

317
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:36,044
And why did I take the job?

318
00:26:36,253 --> 00:26:38,964
Because I'm a rich man
who wanted to give something back.

319
00:26:39,172 --> 00:26:40,715
Not the money, but something.

320
00:26:40,924 --> 00:26:45,095
So here is our chance to
kick some ass for Mother Earth.

321
00:26:45,303 --> 00:26:48,014
- I'm listening.
- Well, I've narrowed your choices down ...

322
00:26:48,223 --> 00:26:50,183
to five unthinkable options.

323
00:26:50,392 --> 00:26:51,977
Each will cause untold misery ...

324
00:26:52,185 --> 00:26:53,687
I pick number three.

325
00:26:53,895 --> 00:26:55,480
You don't wanna read them first?

326
00:26:55,689 --> 00:26:59,317
I was elected to lead, not to read.
Number three!

327
00:27:40,609 --> 00:27:43,570
We're being sealed in a dome!

328
00:27:45,906 --> 00:27:47,616
What do I do?
I don't know what to do!

329
00:27:47,824 --> 00:27:49,951
If I stay, I'm trapped.
If I leave, I'm alone.

330
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,828
Oh, God. In, out, in, out!

331
00:27:52,037 --> 00:27:53,121
I never saw Venice.

332
00:28:06,801 --> 00:28:08,345
"Trapped forever."

333
00:28:08,553 --> 00:28:10,889
It's all come true.

334
00:28:11,097 --> 00:28:14,684
That crazy old man in church
was right.

335
00:28:18,647 --> 00:28:23,818
Dome!

336
00:28:39,668 --> 00:28:41,294
All right, men, open fire.

337
00:28:43,546 --> 00:28:45,298
Who's hurt? Raise your hands.

338
00:28:47,217 --> 00:28:48,301
Without the attitude.

339
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:51,096
People, people.
I have an important announcement.

340
00:28:51,429 --> 00:28:54,516
I have just perfected
an acid-firing super-drill ...

341
00:28:54,724 --> 00:28:57,686
which can cut through anything.
- Hey, that's cool.

342
00:28:57,894 --> 00:28:59,062
It's right there.

343
00:28:59,271 --> 00:29:02,983
Just outside of the dome.

344
00:29:04,693 --> 00:29:08,196
What ruthless madmen
could have done this to us?

345
00:29:08,405 --> 00:29:09,990
The United States government.

346
00:29:12,617 --> 00:29:14,995
My name is Russ Cargill
and I'm head of the EPA.

347
00:29:16,496 --> 00:29:17,497
The what?

348
00:29:17,706 --> 00:29:20,166
- Environmental Protection Agency.
- Come again?

349
00:29:20,375 --> 00:29:22,711
Look, I'm a man on a big TV.
Just listen.

350
00:29:23,086 --> 00:29:25,505
- Springfield has become ...
- Springfield!

351
00:29:25,755 --> 00:29:28,216
- The most polluted city
in the history of the planet.

352
00:29:28,425 --> 00:29:29,759
Drama queen!

353
00:29:30,343 --> 00:29:32,053
To keep your poisons
from spreading ...

354
00:29:32,262 --> 00:29:34,347
your government has sealed you
in this dome.

355
00:29:36,057 --> 00:29:37,851
It's the last thing we wanted to do.

356
00:29:38,059 --> 00:29:40,604
I own the company that makes the 
dome, but that's beside the point.

357
00:29:40,812 --> 00:29:42,522
You mean we're trapped like rats?

358
00:29:42,731 --> 00:29:47,903
No, rats can 't be trapped this easily.
You're trapped like carrots.

359
00:29:48,945 --> 00:29:53,450
Wait. We couldn't be more polluted.
Everyone stopped dumping in the lake.

360
00:29:53,658 --> 00:29:55,827
Apparently someone
didn't get the message.

361
00:29:57,746 --> 00:29:59,706
Act natural.

362
00:29:59,915 --> 00:30:03,418
Hey, buddy, sooner or later,
people are gonna discover this.

363
00:30:03,627 --> 00:30:07,422
Don 't worry about that. We found
a way to take you off the map.

364
00:30:09,132 --> 00:30:11,301
Coming up on your right:

365
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:13,136
Nothing.

366
00:30:13,386 --> 00:30:16,514
This is Kent Brockman, reporting 
to you on a crisis so serious ...

367
00:30:16,723 --> 00:30:18,767
it has its own name
and theme music.

368
00:30:21,978 --> 00:30:24,105
The dome has put an end
to life as we know it.

369
00:30:24,314 --> 00:30:29,444
The town is running low on supplies of
everything from gasoline to Botox.

370
00:30:29,653 --> 00:30:31,613
Moment, please.

371
00:30:34,491 --> 00:30:39,120
Now, as always, we end our news
on "The Lighter Side".

372
00:30:39,329 --> 00:30:42,749
It's the time of year when
the swallows return to Springfield.

373
00:30:54,594 --> 00:30:58,306
I think the thing I miss most
is a simple summer breeze.

374
00:31:04,145 --> 00:31:05,939
Maggie?

375
00:31:07,357 --> 00:31:10,777
We've got dome wax, dome polish,
dome freshener, all your dome needs ...

376
00:31:11,027 --> 00:31:13,321
at Dome Depot,
located at the 105 and the dome.

377
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:15,699
Dome Depot!

378
00:31:15,907 --> 00:31:17,909
Maggie got out! Maggie got out!

379
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:24,207
Maggie was right there,
just outside the dome.

380
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:26,668
Marge, she's right here.

381
00:31:27,877 --> 00:31:32,048
This dome can play tricks on you.
You just have to keep calm and ...

382
00:31:32,257 --> 00:31:33,466
Oh, my God.

383
00:31:33,675 --> 00:31:38,346
I'm out of the dome.
Fresh air! Freedom!

384
00:31:39,222 --> 00:31:40,932
I'll write you. Lead good lives!

385
00:31:56,907 --> 00:31:58,867
Good evening, this is Kent Brockman.

386
00:31:59,075 --> 00:32:01,786
Efforts to find out
whose selfish crime ...

387
00:32:01,995 --> 00:32:04,331
caused our entrapment
have been fruitless.

388
00:32:05,332 --> 00:32:06,416
Until moments ago!

389
00:32:07,167 --> 00:32:11,004
A shocking discovery has been 
made here at Lake Springfield.

390
00:32:11,713 --> 00:32:14,174
That could be anybody's pig-crap silo.

391
00:32:18,219 --> 00:32:21,932
Homer, it was you.

392
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,809
You single-handedly killed this town.

393
00:32:25,018 --> 00:32:27,270
I know. It's weird.

394
00:32:27,479 --> 00:32:30,899
Just a reminder, this station does 
not endorse vigilante justice.

395
00:32:31,107 --> 00:32:33,735
Unless it gets results. 
Which it will.

396
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:39,616
You didn't listen to me
after I warned you.

397
00:32:39,824 --> 00:32:43,370
Don't worry,
nobody watches this stupid show.

398
00:32:43,578 --> 00:32:45,789
What's that ominous glow
in the distance?

399
00:32:48,792 --> 00:32:51,086
Kill! Kill! Kill!

400
00:33:00,095 --> 00:33:03,682
Marge, look. Those idiots
don't even know where we live.

401
00:33:05,016 --> 00:33:06,851
Kill! Kill! Kill!

402
00:33:08,186 --> 00:33:11,022
We want Homer! We want Homer!

403
00:33:11,231 --> 00:33:14,025
You monster. You monster!

404
00:33:14,484 --> 00:33:15,652
Did you see the news?

405
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,779
Honey, come on,
we have bigger problems.

406
00:33:17,988 --> 00:33:20,240
But I'm so angry.

407
00:33:20,448 --> 00:33:23,910
You're a woman.
You can hold on to it forever.

408
00:33:25,495 --> 00:33:26,788
Okay.

409
00:33:27,497 --> 00:33:31,418
Homer, you have to go out there,
face that mob ...

410
00:33:31,626 --> 00:33:33,920
and apologize for what you did.

411
00:33:34,129 --> 00:33:37,382
I would, but I'm afraid if I open 
the door, they'll take all of you.

412
00:33:37,591 --> 00:33:39,593
No, we won't. We just want Homer!

413
00:33:39,801 --> 00:33:42,012
Well, maybe not you,
but they'll kill Grampa.

414
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,930
I'm part of the mob!

415
00:33:46,641 --> 00:33:48,602
Teeny! Take out the baby.

416
00:34:02,574 --> 00:34:04,784
Here, let me get that for you.

417
00:34:11,499 --> 00:34:14,210
Stay back. I got a chain saw.

418
00:34:25,555 --> 00:34:26,556
Bart!

419
00:34:26,765 --> 00:34:28,224
Crawl across. Hurry.

420
00:34:28,433 --> 00:34:30,727
But if they see you helping us,
they'll kill you.

421
00:34:30,936 --> 00:34:33,563
I'm sure your father would
do the same for ...

422
00:34:34,898 --> 00:34:37,192
Point taken. Now, hustle your bustles.

423
00:34:40,862 --> 00:34:42,239
Archers.

424
00:34:42,864 --> 00:34:45,450
I'm using a red arrow
so I know who I kill.

425
00:34:48,954 --> 00:34:53,041
No, Plopper.
If you push that, Daddy will die.

426
00:34:58,546 --> 00:35:01,341
Hey, my luck's beginning to turn.

427
00:35:04,928 --> 00:35:06,721
Wait! There's something I have to get.

428
00:35:24,072 --> 00:35:25,865
- What'd you get?
- Our wedding video.

429
00:35:27,325 --> 00:35:29,578
- We have a wedding video?
- Torch his gas tank!

430
00:35:33,707 --> 00:35:35,667
We lost them.

431
00:35:50,265 --> 00:35:51,850
Up here.

432
00:35:53,268 --> 00:35:54,269
Get them! Get them!

433
00:35:59,107 --> 00:36:00,442
Little help?

434
00:36:05,071 --> 00:36:07,782
You know, the word "apology" ...

435
00:36:07,991 --> 00:36:13,705
is tossed around a lot these days,
but when it comes from in here ...

436
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:28,136
Mom, what are we gonna do?

437
00:36:30,347 --> 00:36:31,681
Maggie, not now.

438
00:36:33,391 --> 00:36:34,559
We'll play later.

439
00:36:42,442 --> 00:36:45,654
The sinkhole. Follow me, kids!

440
00:36:45,862 --> 00:36:47,948
- Geronimo!
- Sacajawea!

441
00:36:53,286 --> 00:36:55,872
So long, losers!

442
00:37:02,128 --> 00:37:05,257
The top of his head is still showing.
Claw at it!

443
00:37:39,207 --> 00:37:43,128
Well, they're China's problem now.

444
00:37:53,096 --> 00:37:54,264
Colin!

445
00:38:01,104 --> 00:38:03,231
I can't hear you!

446
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:27,797
I never thought my life would have an
absolutely perfect moment, but this is ...

447
00:38:28,006 --> 00:38:31,509
Lisa's got a boyfriend
that she'll never see again!

448
00:38:32,802 --> 00:38:34,596
- Perfect.

449
00:38:45,148 --> 00:38:48,944
- What do we do?
- Now we run.

450
00:38:52,822 --> 00:38:54,449
I'm afraid we lost them, sir.

451
00:38:54,658 --> 00:38:55,992
Damn it!

452
00:38:56,201 --> 00:38:59,120
Well, then, you find them
and you get them back in the dome.

453
00:38:59,329 --> 00:39:00,747
And so nobody else gets out ...

454
00:39:00,956 --> 00:39:03,625
I want roving death squads
around the perimeter 24/7.

455
00:39:03,833 --> 00:39:05,126
I want 10,000 tough guys ...

456
00:39:05,335 --> 00:39:08,546
and I want 10,000 soft guys
to make the tough guys look tougher.

457
00:39:08,755 --> 00:39:11,967
And here's how I want them arranged:
Tough, tough, soft, tough ...

458
00:39:12,175 --> 00:39:17,180
soft, soft, tough, tough,
soft, soft, tough, soft.

459
00:39:17,806 --> 00:39:20,725
Sir, I'm afraid you've
gone mad with power.

460
00:39:20,934 --> 00:39:24,938
Of course. Ever try going mad without
power? It's boring. No one listens to you.

461
00:39:54,384 --> 00:39:57,387
- Bart, are you drinking whiskey?
- I'm troubled.

462
00:39:57,596 --> 00:39:59,848
- Bart.
- I promise, I'll stop tomorrow.

463
00:40:00,056 --> 00:40:02,475
You'll stop right now.

464
00:40:06,771 --> 00:40:08,231
You come back here, little man.

465
00:40:11,234 --> 00:40:15,614
I miss Flanders. There, I said it!

466
00:40:16,156 --> 00:40:18,033
- Where's your father?
- He went out.

467
00:40:18,241 --> 00:40:20,702
Let's quickly rebuild our lives
while he's gone.

468
00:40:20,911 --> 00:40:22,537
Hey, guys?

469
00:40:22,996 --> 00:40:25,540
What's the secret knock, again?

470
00:40:28,418 --> 00:40:31,880
Look, I know I screwed up. 
This is big.

471
00:40:32,088 --> 00:40:34,466
It's huge! We're homeless!

472
00:40:34,674 --> 00:40:36,760
Our friends wanna kill us!

473
00:40:36,968 --> 00:40:39,387
Before we can even stay
in the same room with you ...

474
00:40:39,596 --> 00:40:42,057
I need to know what was
going through your mind ...

475
00:40:42,265 --> 00:40:44,559
when you didn't listen to me ...

476
00:40:44,768 --> 00:40:48,271
and dumped that silo in the lake.

477
00:40:48,647 --> 00:40:49,731
Homer!

478
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:53,568
I don't know what to tell you, Marge.
I don't think about things.

479
00:40:53,777 --> 00:40:55,904
I respect people who do ...

480
00:40:56,112 --> 00:41:01,618
but I just try to make the days not hurt
until I get to crawl in next to you again.

481
00:41:04,454 --> 00:41:05,497
I mean, oh.

482
00:41:05,956 --> 00:41:09,876
Look, I'm really sorry.
But I'm more than just sorry ...

483
00:41:10,085 --> 00:41:11,920
I'm prepared with a solution.

484
00:41:12,504 --> 00:41:16,716
I've always been afraid I'd screw up our
lives so badly we'd need a backup plan.

485
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:21,638
And that plan is right here!

486
00:41:23,807 --> 00:41:24,808
No.

487
00:41:25,016 --> 00:41:26,101
Nope.

488
00:41:26,309 --> 00:41:27,936
Bingo.

489
00:41:31,606 --> 00:41:32,941
Bear with me.

490
00:41:37,946 --> 00:41:39,030
Alaska?

491
00:41:39,239 --> 00:41:43,201
Alaska. A place where you can't 
be too fat or too drunk.

492
00:41:43,410 --> 00:41:45,078
Where no one says things like:

493
00:41:45,287 --> 00:41:48,665
"Let's see your high school
equivalency certificate."

494
00:41:49,374 --> 00:41:51,001
I don't know, Homie.

495
00:41:52,168 --> 00:41:53,628
I'm not saying it right.

496
00:41:53,837 --> 00:41:57,549
Look, the thing is,
I can't start a new life alone.

497
00:41:57,757 --> 00:42:00,510
And I've really come to like you guys.

498
00:42:02,345 --> 00:42:04,931
I just don't see it.

499
00:42:08,935 --> 00:42:12,647
Marge, in every marriage,
you get one chance to say:

500
00:42:12,856 --> 00:42:15,108
"I need you to do this with me."

501
00:42:17,652 --> 00:42:21,072
And there's only one answer
when somebody says that.

502
00:42:26,536 --> 00:42:29,831
Okay, Homie, I'm with you.

503
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:31,708
Thank you, my sweetheart.

504
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:34,085
- Mom?
- Yes, honey?

505
00:42:34,711 --> 00:42:36,546
You just bought
another load of crap ...

506
00:42:36,755 --> 00:42:39,799
from the world's fattest
fertilizer salesman.

507
00:42:40,008 --> 00:42:42,510
You'll pay for ruining
this golden family moment!

508
00:42:42,719 --> 00:42:43,720
Homer!

509
00:42:43,929 --> 00:42:47,224
How are we supposed to get 
to Alaska without any money?

510
00:42:47,432 --> 00:42:51,895
All right, son. If you don't 
believe in me, believe in America.

511
00:42:52,562 --> 00:42:58,652
America. Where any man can make
quick money with no questions asked.

512
00:43:01,238 --> 00:43:03,323
Step right up and win my truck!

513
00:43:03,531 --> 00:43:06,826
All you have to do is conquer
the Ball of Death.

514
00:43:07,035 --> 00:43:08,411
- What's the catch?
- No catch.

515
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:12,540
Just ride the motorcycle
all the way around just one time.

516
00:43:12,749 --> 00:43:14,834
Three tries for $ 10.

517
00:43:15,210 --> 00:43:18,338
- Marge, how much money do we have?
- Ten dollars.

518
00:43:20,757 --> 00:43:22,300
That counts as a try.

519
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:28,348
That's two.

520
00:43:30,684 --> 00:43:31,893
And that's three.

521
00:43:32,102 --> 00:43:34,854
Here's what I'll do, because I 
like seeing you hurt yourself:

522
00:43:35,063 --> 00:43:36,523
I'll give you one on the house.

523
00:43:36,731 --> 00:43:38,567
- You're the best.
- Dad!

524
00:43:38,775 --> 00:43:42,445
When you get to the top,
don't slow down, speed up!

525
00:43:42,654 --> 00:43:45,615
- But that's when it's the scariest.
- Just do it!

526
00:43:57,752 --> 00:43:59,254
Yes!

527
00:44:01,381 --> 00:44:03,258
Yay, Dad!

528
00:44:10,307 --> 00:44:12,517
I'll take that truck now.

529
00:44:15,186 --> 00:44:17,689
Oh, man. 
My wives are gonna kill me.

530
00:44:19,941 --> 00:44:23,486
Next stop, Alaska!

531
00:44:29,284 --> 00:44:31,286
Day 37 under the dome.

532
00:44:31,494 --> 00:44:35,373
We are facing intermittent
power failures which ...

533
00:44:38,501 --> 00:44:41,755
Okay, very funny.
I'm gonna turn the lights off again.

534
00:44:41,963 --> 00:44:45,050
When they come back on, I want 
all my booze back the way it was.

535
00:44:49,721 --> 00:44:52,807
Yeah, okay. Okay.

536
00:44:59,481 --> 00:45:03,485
I'm very proud of you, Bart.
Over 24 hours sober.

537
00:45:03,693 --> 00:45:05,987
- You are, aren't you?
- I'll prove it.

538
00:45:11,952 --> 00:45:15,789
We're giving your father another 
chance, and we owe it to him to ...

539
00:45:17,207 --> 00:45:18,667
- Oh, my God.
- Can I help you?

540
00:45:21,211 --> 00:45:22,712
We need diapers.

541
00:45:22,921 --> 00:45:25,131
- Okay.
- No. No, we don't. We don't.

542
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:27,259
- Ladies' razorblades.
- Right.

543
00:45:27,467 --> 00:45:31,471
No! No. No, we don't.
I forgot, we're European.

544
00:45:32,013 --> 00:45:33,431
Just give us beef jerky.

545
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:36,393
Lots and lots of beef jerky.

546
00:45:36,601 --> 00:45:39,479
That's right. That's what we need.
That's all we came in for.

547
00:45:39,688 --> 00:45:41,022
Sure.

548
00:45:44,359 --> 00:45:46,570
Oh, my God. There they are!

549
00:46:06,172 --> 00:46:10,093
So you want some of my electricity,
do you?

550
00:46:11,386 --> 00:46:14,681
Well, for once,
the rich white man is in control.

551
00:46:14,890 --> 00:46:17,017
I have two buttons behind this desk.

552
00:46:17,225 --> 00:46:21,855
One will supply your town with power,
the other releases the hounds.

553
00:46:22,147 --> 00:46:24,858
Reach me. Make me your brother.

554
00:46:25,108 --> 00:46:27,277
The hospital's generator
is about to give out.

555
00:46:27,485 --> 00:46:28,737
Lives will be lost.

556
00:46:29,070 --> 00:46:32,699
"Lives lost." Go on.

557
00:46:32,908 --> 00:46:36,036
We got a convict we were gonna
fry tomorrow, but now we can't.

558
00:46:36,244 --> 00:46:38,622
Tempting. Tempting.

559
00:46:38,830 --> 00:46:40,540
Look, all our reasons mean nothing.

560
00:46:40,749 --> 00:46:44,461
Just look into your heart
and you'll find the answer.

561
00:46:47,923 --> 00:46:50,759
- First door on the right.
- Thank you.

562
00:46:58,767 --> 00:47:02,604
What ...? This isn't the way
I pictured Alaska at all!

563
00:47:02,812 --> 00:47:04,272
Oh, that's better.

564
00:47:04,481 --> 00:47:06,233
Homer!

565
00:47:12,656 --> 00:47:15,492
Well, at least my poster
didn't get torn.

566
00:47:26,670 --> 00:47:29,881
Welcome to Alaska. Here's $ 1,000.

567
00:47:30,090 --> 00:47:32,676
Well, it's about time! But why?

568
00:47:32,884 --> 00:47:34,844
We pay every resident $ 1,000 ...

569
00:47:35,053 --> 00:47:37,973
to allow oil companies to ravage
our state's natural beauty.

570
00:47:38,181 --> 00:47:40,267
I'm home!

571
00:47:40,475 --> 00:47:42,352
Oh, thanks.

572
00:47:59,828 --> 00:48:01,621
What are you doing, Bart?

573
00:48:01,830 --> 00:48:03,290
Just passing the time.

574
00:48:16,928 --> 00:48:20,515
My boy loves Alaska so much,
he's applauding it.

575
00:48:20,724 --> 00:48:23,184
- Lisa, why aren't you clapping?
- But, Dad ...

576
00:48:23,393 --> 00:48:24,853
Clap for Alaska!

577
00:48:42,037 --> 00:48:46,416
Well, Marge, we're separated
from the kids by a wall of snow.

578
00:48:46,625 --> 00:48:50,378
All my dreams are coming true.

579
00:49:21,451 --> 00:49:23,119
We're going to need more birds.

580
00:49:44,641 --> 00:49:46,434
Day 93 under the dome.

581
00:49:46,643 --> 00:49:48,937
With necessities growing
dangerously low ...

582
00:49:49,145 --> 00:49:52,107
who knows what spark will set 
off this powder keg?

583
00:49:53,525 --> 00:49:55,735
- Let's discuss Tuesdays with Morrie.
- Again?

584
00:49:55,944 --> 00:49:58,613
If we don't get a new book,
I'm going to puke.

585
00:49:58,822 --> 00:50:02,492
You're the five people
I'm going to meet in hell!

586
00:50:04,452 --> 00:50:06,454
We're out of coffee!

587
00:50:08,582 --> 00:50:11,835
I can't take another minute
in this dome!

588
00:50:22,679 --> 00:50:24,556
Take that.

589
00:50:24,931 --> 00:50:26,391
Oh, no! Blowback!

590
00:50:32,856 --> 00:50:34,524
Look what they're doing to our dome.

591
00:50:42,157 --> 00:50:43,408
You know what that is, sir?

592
00:50:43,617 --> 00:50:45,327
- A crack?
- Exactly.

593
00:50:45,535 --> 00:50:48,705
People got out of the dome before,
they're gonna get out again.

594
00:50:48,914 --> 00:50:51,750
When they do, there's gonna be
hearings, investigations ...

595
00:50:53,251 --> 00:50:55,712
I'll have to go back to
making family comedies.

596
00:50:57,714 --> 00:50:59,758
Don't worry,
I have a solution for you, sir.

597
00:50:59,966 --> 00:51:02,510
In fact, I have five solutions.

598
00:51:02,719 --> 00:51:05,180
You don't have to read them.
You'll have deniability.

599
00:51:05,388 --> 00:51:07,182
I'll take care of it. 
You know nothing.

600
00:51:08,225 --> 00:51:10,185
No. I need to know
what I'm approving.

601
00:51:10,393 --> 00:51:14,314
Absolutely. But on the other hand,
knowing things is overrated.

602
00:51:14,522 --> 00:51:16,858
Anyone can pick something
when they know what it is.

603
00:51:17,067 --> 00:51:20,403
It takes real leadership to pick
something you're clueless about.

604
00:51:21,488 --> 00:51:23,031
- Okay, I pick three.
- Try again.

605
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:25,033
- One. Five?
- Go higher. Too high.

606
00:51:25,242 --> 00:51:26,368
- Three?
- You said three.

607
00:51:26,576 --> 00:51:28,370
- Six? Two?
- There is no six. Double it.

608
00:51:28,578 --> 00:51:29,913
- Four!
- As you wish, sir.

609
00:51:42,676 --> 00:51:46,137
Are you tired of
the same old Grand Canyon?

610
00:51:46,346 --> 00:51:49,224
Here we are, kids, 
the Grand Canyon.

611
00:51:49,432 --> 00:51:53,770
It's so old and boring.
I want a new one. Now!

612
00:51:53,979 --> 00:51:56,106
Hello. I'm Tom Hanks.

613
00:51:56,314 --> 00:51:58,608
The U.S. Government
has lost its credibility ...

614
00:51:58,817 --> 00:52:00,485
so it's borrowing some of mine.

615
00:52:00,694 --> 00:52:02,070
Tousle my hair, Mr. Hanks.

616
00:52:02,279 --> 00:52:04,239
Sure thing, son.

617
00:52:05,991 --> 00:52:09,077
Now, I'm pleased to tell you all
about the New Grand Canyon.

618
00:52:10,495 --> 00:52:12,789
This weekend. East of Shelbyville
and south of Capitol City.

619
00:52:13,290 --> 00:52:14,874
That's where Springfield is!

620
00:52:15,083 --> 00:52:17,460
It's nowhere near where
anything is or ever was.

621
00:52:17,669 --> 00:52:18,837
This is Tom Hanks, saying:

622
00:52:19,045 --> 00:52:22,048
If you're going to pick a government
to trust, why not this one?

623
00:52:22,591 --> 00:52:23,592
Did you see that?

624
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:26,511
Yes, they're going
to destroy Springfield.

625
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:28,471
But we're going to stop them.

626
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:31,474
Homie, get your clothes on. Homie?

627
00:52:31,683 --> 00:52:33,977
I'm happy here. Screw Springfield!

628
00:52:35,437 --> 00:52:38,481
I can't believe you'd say
something so selfish.

629
00:52:38,690 --> 00:52:41,860
Marge, those people chased us
with pitchforks and torches.

630
00:52:42,068 --> 00:52:44,446
Torches! At 4 in the afternoon!

631
00:52:44,654 --> 00:52:47,449
- It was 7 at night.
- It was during Access Hollywood.

632
00:52:47,657 --> 00:52:49,492
Which is on at 4 and 7.

633
00:52:50,243 --> 00:52:53,538
Dad, how can you turn your back
on everyone who loved us?

634
00:52:53,747 --> 00:52:55,540
Flanders helped
when we were in trouble.

635
00:52:55,749 --> 00:52:57,792
Who cares what he did?
He's not your father.

636
00:52:58,001 --> 00:52:59,169
I wish he was.

637
00:52:59,377 --> 00:53:01,379
You don't mean that.
You worship me.

638
00:53:01,588 --> 00:53:03,924
Oh, yeah?
Look what I did to your picture.

639
00:53:04,591 --> 00:53:05,592
Look at it.

640
00:53:05,842 --> 00:53:07,677
How-dilly-doo-dilly.
How-dilly-doo-dilly.

641
00:53:07,886 --> 00:53:09,346
Why, you little ...!

642
00:53:10,347 --> 00:53:11,890
I'll strangle-angle you!

643
00:53:12,098 --> 00:53:13,391
Diddily-diddily.

644
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:15,936
Bart, stop it! Leave this to me.

645
00:53:17,270 --> 00:53:19,022
Homer ...

646
00:53:19,564 --> 00:53:23,109
in every marriage,
you get one chance to say:

647
00:53:23,318 --> 00:53:26,404
"I need you to do this with me."

648
00:53:27,864 --> 00:53:31,576
That is the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

649
00:53:31,785 --> 00:53:32,953
Homer Simpson!

650
00:53:33,161 --> 00:53:34,704
We're saving Springfield!

651
00:53:34,913 --> 00:53:37,082
Listen to me, all of you.
We are staying.

652
00:53:37,290 --> 00:53:38,833
We have a great life in Alaska ...

653
00:53:39,042 --> 00:53:42,295
and we're never going
back to America again.

654
00:53:42,504 --> 00:53:44,464
I have spoken!

655
00:54:04,150 --> 00:54:09,239
Well, I guess I've let her
worry about me long enough.

656
00:54:21,251 --> 00:54:23,962
Marge? Kids?

657
00:54:37,309 --> 00:54:39,185
Okay, here goes.

658
00:54:39,394 --> 00:54:40,770
Homer ...

659
00:54:40,979 --> 00:54:42,939
I've always stood up for you.

660
00:54:43,148 --> 00:54:46,276
When people point out your flaws ...

661
00:54:46,484 --> 00:54:48,278
I always say:

662
00:54:48,486 --> 00:54:53,575
"Well, sometimes you have to stand 
back to appreciate a work of art."

663
00:54:54,826 --> 00:54:56,328
Way back.

664
00:54:56,536 --> 00:54:59,789
Lately, what's keeping us together ...

665
00:54:59,998 --> 00:55:04,252
is my ability to overlook
everything you do.

666
00:55:04,461 --> 00:55:08,214
And I overlook these things
because ...

667
00:55:08,548 --> 00:55:09,799
Because?

668
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:12,969
Well, that's the thing.

669
00:55:13,178 --> 00:55:17,432
I just don 't know how to finish
that sentence anymore.

670
00:55:18,225 --> 00:55:22,020
So I'm leaving with the kids
to help Springfield ...

671
00:55:22,229 --> 00:55:24,856
and we're never coming back.

672
00:55:27,943 --> 00:55:31,613
And to prove to myself
that this is the end ...

673
00:55:32,864 --> 00:55:36,743
I taped this over our wedding video.

674
00:55:38,036 --> 00:55:40,163
Goodbye, Homie.

675
00:55:53,552 --> 00:55:56,304
I love you.

676
00:55:59,849 --> 00:56:02,310
Marge? Kids?

677
00:56:54,738 --> 00:56:57,616
- So, Mom, what's our plan?
- What are you doing up there?

678
00:56:57,824 --> 00:56:59,534
Looking through people's luggage.

679
00:56:59,743 --> 00:57:02,662
I'm the mascot of an evil corporation.

680
00:57:02,871 --> 00:57:06,374
Get down from there.
We have to keep a low profile ...

681
00:57:06,583 --> 00:57:10,670
till we get to Seattle to tell the world
of the plot to destroy Springfield.

682
00:57:10,879 --> 00:57:13,381
I don't know if you guys
should be talking so loud.

683
00:57:13,590 --> 00:57:17,886
Oh, Lisa, it's not like the government
is listening to everybody's conversation.

684
00:57:26,228 --> 00:57:28,563
Hi, I'm calling about
your Meat Lover's pizza.

685
00:57:28,772 --> 00:57:31,900
I like meat, but I don 't know
if I'm ready to love again.

686
00:57:32,108 --> 00:57:35,362
- You hang up first.
- No, you hang up first.

687
00:57:35,570 --> 00:57:36,905
Okay.

688
00:57:37,113 --> 00:57:38,949
She hung up on me!

689
00:57:39,157 --> 00:57:43,495
But we're fugitives. We should
just lay low till we get to Seattle.

690
00:57:43,828 --> 00:57:45,580
Hey, everybody, I found one!

691
00:57:45,789 --> 00:57:49,668
The government actually found
someone we're looking for!

692
00:57:49,876 --> 00:57:51,711
Yeah, baby, yeah!

693
00:57:53,463 --> 00:57:54,714
Homer Simpson ...

694
00:57:56,675 --> 00:57:58,468
do you know why you are here?

695
00:57:58,677 --> 00:58:02,597
Because my family cares more about
other people than they do about me.

696
00:58:02,806 --> 00:58:05,183
Drink this liquid.

697
00:58:07,644 --> 00:58:09,145
More, please.

698
00:58:09,938 --> 00:58:12,023
Now we will cleanse your spirit ...

699
00:58:12,232 --> 00:58:15,443
by the ancient Inuit art
of throat singing.

700
00:58:15,652 --> 00:58:17,779
Throat singing?

701
00:58:28,331 --> 00:58:29,916
How long are we doing this?

702
00:58:30,125 --> 00:58:30,542
- Until you have an epiphany.
- Okay.

703
00:58:30,542 --> 00:58:33,878
- Until you have an epiphany.
- Okay.

704
00:58:37,340 --> 00:58:38,383
What's an epiphany?

705
00:58:38,592 --> 00:58:41,636
Sudden realization of great truth.

706
00:58:41,845 --> 00:58:42,846
Okay.

707
00:58:57,402 --> 00:59:00,989
Spider-Pig, Spider-Pig

708
00:59:01,197 --> 00:59:04,576
Does whatever a Spider-Pig does

709
00:59:04,784 --> 00:59:05,911
Look out!

710
00:59:06,369 --> 00:59:10,332
He's a Spider-Pig

711
00:59:11,875 --> 00:59:14,002
Unless you have an epiphany ...

712
00:59:14,210 --> 00:59:18,131
you will spend the remainder
of your days alone.

713
00:59:20,175 --> 00:59:21,468
Epiphany, epiphany, epiphany.

714
00:59:22,177 --> 00:59:25,639
Bananas are an excellent source
of potassium.

715
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:30,477
Americans will never embrace soccer?

716
00:59:32,604 --> 00:59:35,523
More than two shakes
and it's playing with yourself?

717
00:59:38,235 --> 00:59:40,362
Hey, what are you doing?

718
00:59:43,907 --> 00:59:48,703
Oh, do whatever you want to me.
I don't care about myself anymore.

719
00:59:50,580 --> 00:59:52,874
Because ...?

720
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:57,879
Because other people
are just as important as me.

721
00:59:58,255 --> 01:00:02,384
Without them, I'm nothing.

722
01:00:04,177 --> 01:00:07,556
In order to save myself ...

723
01:00:07,764 --> 01:00:10,308
I have to save Springfield!

724
01:00:10,517 --> 01:00:13,395
That's it! Isn't it?

725
01:00:25,991 --> 01:00:28,910
That was the most
incredible experience of my life.

726
01:00:29,119 --> 01:00:34,332
And now to find my family,
save my town and drop 10 pounds!

727
01:00:34,666 --> 01:00:36,418
Thank you, boob lady.

728
01:00:44,134 --> 01:00:47,262
This is it, kids. Seattle.

729
01:00:47,470 --> 01:00:50,473
Russ Cargill! 
Do you think he saw us?

730
01:00:54,227 --> 01:00:55,770
Yes, I did.

731
01:01:00,692 --> 01:01:02,444
Run! Run!

732
01:01:03,028 --> 01:01:04,696
Run! Run!

733
01:01:05,196 --> 01:01:06,990
Run! Run!

734
01:01:07,699 --> 01:01:09,659
Jump! Jump!

735
01:01:09,868 --> 01:01:11,870
Land! Land!

736
01:01:12,329 --> 01:01:14,289
Rest! Rest!

737
01:01:14,998 --> 01:01:16,374
Run! Run!

738
01:01:19,044 --> 01:01:21,129
Now, I know we've had a rough day ...

739
01:01:21,338 --> 01:01:24,299
but I'm sure we can put all that
behind us and ...

740
01:01:27,385 --> 01:01:29,054
That's my whipping arm!

741
01:01:32,182 --> 01:01:35,852
Why does everything I whip leave me?

742
01:01:37,187 --> 01:01:41,316
Must keep going. Must keep going.

743
01:01:41,524 --> 01:01:45,487
No, I can't. I can't keep going.

744
01:01:45,695 --> 01:01:47,781
Yes, you can.

745
01:01:47,989 --> 01:01:49,783
No, I can't!

746
01:01:49,991 --> 01:01:51,660
Oh, shut up!

747
01:01:51,868 --> 01:01:53,453
You shut up.

748
01:01:53,662 --> 01:01:55,497
No, you. No, you.

749
01:01:55,705 --> 01:01:58,500
No, you. Oh, real mature.

750
01:01:58,708 --> 01:02:01,002
How could you say that?

751
01:02:01,211 --> 01:02:03,213
Oh, what's the point?

752
01:02:03,421 --> 01:02:05,757
It's hopeless.

753
01:02:13,723 --> 01:02:17,310
Don't give up, Homer.
You are closer than you think.

754
01:02:17,519 --> 01:02:19,145
But which way do I go?

755
01:02:24,568 --> 01:02:26,361
Much obliged.

756
01:02:40,709 --> 01:02:42,836
Ten-hut!

757
01:02:48,091 --> 01:02:50,260
Lisa! Knock off that racket.

758
01:02:50,468 --> 01:02:51,469
Lisa!

759
01:02:53,722 --> 01:02:57,392
They captured my family.
What do I do? What do I do?

760
01:03:03,607 --> 01:03:06,401
There's something strange
about that "sop" sign.

761
01:03:24,544 --> 01:03:26,671
- Did you hear something?
- Probably just a moth.

762
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:28,298
I hope it's okay.

763
01:03:52,572 --> 01:03:56,034
Look, we can't keep stopping at
every "sop", "yeld" or "one vay" sign.

764
01:03:56,243 --> 01:03:57,452
Just move on.

765
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:05,252
Let us out! Let us out!

766
01:04:05,460 --> 01:04:07,629
Stop that.
You'll scratch your shackles.

767
01:04:07,837 --> 01:04:09,881
I hope I do.

768
01:04:16,179 --> 01:04:19,391
Oh, way to go, Bart.

769
01:04:19,599 --> 01:04:20,976
You stink.

770
01:04:21,184 --> 01:04:24,938
No, you stink.

771
01:04:40,203 --> 01:04:41,955
Springfield.

772
01:04:42,289 --> 01:04:44,624
I can't believe it,
but it got even crappier.

773
01:04:49,129 --> 01:04:50,505
Oh, man.

774
01:05:00,223 --> 01:05:01,308
Oh, hi, Midge.

775
01:05:01,516 --> 01:05:03,602
Moe, what happened?

776
01:05:03,810 --> 01:05:08,273
With the town sealed off from the rest of
the world, things got a little nutty here.

777
01:05:08,481 --> 01:05:09,858
Why are you dressed like that?

778
01:05:10,066 --> 01:05:14,487
Well, I don't like to brag, but I 
am now the emperor of Springfield.

779
01:05:14,696 --> 01:05:16,031
No, you're not!

780
01:05:16,239 --> 01:05:18,533
Yes, I am!

781
01:05:19,743 --> 01:05:22,329
Okay. Hail, emperor.

782
01:05:22,537 --> 01:05:24,581
Attention, Springfield.

783
01:05:26,124 --> 01:05:30,253
Your government realized that putting you
inside this dome was a terrible mistake.

784
01:05:30,462 --> 01:05:33,798
Therefore, we're commencing with
Operation Soaring Eagle.

785
01:05:35,508 --> 01:05:37,052
Which involves killing you all.

786
01:05:45,310 --> 01:05:49,272
As I speak, we're lowering a small
but powerful bomb into your midst.

787
01:05:58,281 --> 01:06:02,244
Despite everything, I miss your father.

788
01:06:02,452 --> 01:06:04,120
Me too.

789
01:06:04,329 --> 01:06:06,998
His big, fat ass could shield us all.

790
01:06:11,586 --> 01:06:12,587
Ten-hut!

791
01:06:14,130 --> 01:06:17,676
At ease. I'm General Marriott Suites ...

792
01:06:17,884 --> 01:06:20,262
and I have an urgent note
from the president.

793
01:06:20,470 --> 01:06:22,847
It says to release
this town immediately.

794
01:06:23,306 --> 01:06:24,641
Why is it written on a leaf?

795
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:48,081
Perfect.

796
01:06:50,542 --> 01:06:55,505
Now Homer Simpson's gonna show
he has cojones!

797
01:07:13,023 --> 01:07:14,983
Mom, I've gotta go find Colin.

798
01:07:15,191 --> 01:07:19,446
Not now, sweetie.
Doomsday is family time.

799
01:07:24,367 --> 01:07:28,914
Hey. If one of us distracts Cargill,
the rest of us can climb up that thing.

800
01:07:29,122 --> 01:07:32,918
Who'd be dumb enough to stay behind
while we escape with our lives?

801
01:07:33,627 --> 01:07:35,795
My time to shine.

802
01:07:36,338 --> 01:07:39,549
Hey, Mr. Big TV Man, lookie here!

803
01:07:39,966 --> 01:07:41,468
What do you want?

804
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:45,847
Look what I can do with my thumb.

805
01:07:46,723 --> 01:07:48,642
You wanna know how I do it?

806
01:07:48,850 --> 01:07:51,144
Four generations of inbreeding?

807
01:08:06,743 --> 01:08:08,453
I can smell fresh air.

808
01:08:09,412 --> 01:08:11,456
I can hear birds.

809
01:08:11,665 --> 01:08:13,959
I taste freedom.

810
01:08:14,167 --> 01:08:16,294
Excuse me!
Watch out! Coming through!

811
01:08:24,219 --> 01:08:25,679
I was tricked by an idiot.

812
01:08:25,887 --> 01:08:31,518
Hey, I know how you feel. I was 
beat in tic-tac-toe by a chicken.

813
01:08:31,726 --> 01:08:33,186
Goodbye.

814
01:08:35,981 --> 01:08:37,315
Homer do good?

815
01:08:37,732 --> 01:08:42,654
Actually, you doomed us all. 
Again. Nice knowing you, Homer.

816
01:08:42,862 --> 01:08:44,239
But I ...

817
01:08:47,325 --> 01:08:49,953
I can't do anything right.

818
01:08:52,956 --> 01:08:55,125
Get out of here!

819
01:09:02,424 --> 01:09:06,386
I've spent my entire life doing nothing
but collecting comic books.

820
01:09:06,595 --> 01:09:09,264
And now there's only time to say:

821
01:09:09,472 --> 01:09:11,308
Life well spent!

822
01:09:16,313 --> 01:09:21,026
Okay, boys. When you meet Jesus,
be sure to call him Mr. Christ.

823
01:09:21,234 --> 01:09:23,028
Will Buddha be there too?

824
01:09:23,236 --> 01:09:24,321
No.

825
01:09:24,654 --> 01:09:26,448
- Hey, Flanders.
- Bart.

826
01:09:26,740 --> 01:09:30,702
How good to see you.
And how terrible you're here.

827
01:09:30,994 --> 01:09:32,621
Thanks.

828
01:09:32,829 --> 01:09:37,292
Listen. I was just wondering if ...

829
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:39,628
before I died ...

830
01:09:39,836 --> 01:09:43,715
I could pretend I had a father who ...

831
01:09:43,924 --> 01:09:45,342
cared for me.

832
01:09:46,676 --> 01:09:48,220
Come here, son.

833
01:09:48,428 --> 01:09:51,723
There's always room for one more
in the Flanders clan.

834
01:09:56,436 --> 01:09:59,814
Come on, bomb-disarming robot.
You're our last hope.

835
01:10:00,023 --> 01:10:04,527
Red wire. Blue wire.
Black is usually the ground.

836
01:10:05,695 --> 01:10:07,405
So much pressure.

837
01:10:08,573 --> 01:10:09,824
Pressure!

838
01:10:13,828 --> 01:10:16,957
He'd been talking about it,
but I didn't take him seriously.

839
01:10:23,046 --> 01:10:24,214
Marge.

840
01:10:24,422 --> 01:10:26,675
Marge! Marge!

841
01:10:27,842 --> 01:10:29,803
Oh, no, the "epipha-tree"!

842
01:10:30,011 --> 01:10:33,807
Hey, I tried my best.
What am I supposed to do?

843
01:10:35,058 --> 01:10:38,311
But how am I
supposed to get up there?

844
01:10:43,358 --> 01:10:46,027
Here. Buy yourself something nice.

845
01:10:50,657 --> 01:10:53,368
Homer? What the hell
are you doing now?

846
01:10:53,577 --> 01:10:55,412
Risking my life to save 
people I hate ...

847
01:10:55,620 --> 01:10:58,248
for reasons I don't quite 
understand. Gotta go!

848
01:10:59,708 --> 01:11:01,710
But first, one stop.

849
01:11:08,675 --> 01:11:11,303
Bart? Son?

850
01:11:11,511 --> 01:11:13,513
You think you could find it
in your heart ...

851
01:11:13,722 --> 01:11:16,349
to give your foolish old man
one more chance?

852
01:11:16,725 --> 01:11:19,519
Oh, I don't know.

853
01:11:19,728 --> 01:11:22,272
It seems to me, son,
that your father's saying that ...

854
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:25,734
he wants to spend
his last minute with you.

855
01:11:28,445 --> 01:11:30,363
No. I can't do it.

856
01:11:30,780 --> 01:11:34,743
I want a father who's the same
in the morning as he is at night.

857
01:11:34,951 --> 01:11:36,244
What's that word?

858
01:11:36,453 --> 01:11:37,746
- Consistency.
- Consistency.

859
01:11:37,954 --> 01:11:39,414
Thanks, losers.

860
01:11:39,623 --> 01:11:40,749
Sorry, Homer.

861
01:11:42,292 --> 01:11:44,586
I'll let you hold the bomb.

862
01:11:45,921 --> 01:11:47,422
The man knows me.

863
01:11:51,885 --> 01:11:54,221
I wish Homer was my father.

864
01:11:54,429 --> 01:11:57,390
And I wish you didn't have
the devil's curly hair.

865
01:12:05,482 --> 01:12:10,445
I've been taking your crap all my life!

866
01:12:13,114 --> 01:12:16,618
This feels good. No wonder you do it.

867
01:12:20,664 --> 01:12:23,875
Okay, you've only got one shot to 
throw that bomb through the hole.

868
01:12:24,084 --> 01:12:26,419
Dad, in case I miss ...

869
01:12:26,628 --> 01:12:29,297
I'm sorry I said I wished
you weren't my father.

870
01:12:29,506 --> 01:12:32,676
I don't blame you, son.
I wasn't much of a father.

871
01:12:32,884 --> 01:12:35,554
Maybe it starts with the way
my dad raised me.

872
01:12:35,762 --> 01:12:40,141
Yes. It's clear to me. It's just been
one long, unbroken cycle of ...

873
01:12:40,350 --> 01:12:43,019
Somebody throw the goddamn bomb!

874
01:13:05,250 --> 01:13:07,252
What? What's going on?

875
01:13:31,776 --> 01:13:33,069
We did it, boy!

876
01:13:33,445 --> 01:13:34,946
Dad?

877
01:14:25,163 --> 01:14:27,958
It's amazing no one was hurt.

878
01:14:28,750 --> 01:14:31,628
Bye, everybody.

879
01:14:33,964 --> 01:14:37,259
Now, that was
a great father-son activity.

880
01:14:37,467 --> 01:14:39,761
Hello, Homer.

881
01:14:40,595 --> 01:14:44,307
So we meet at last, whoever you are.

882
01:14:44,516 --> 01:14:47,561
There's two things they don't teach 
you at Harvard Business School.

883
01:14:47,769 --> 01:14:50,480
How to cope with defeat,
and how to handle a shotgun.

884
01:14:50,689 --> 01:14:53,191
I'm going to do both right now.

885
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:55,569
Wait! If you kill my dad ...

886
01:14:55,777 --> 01:14:58,029
you'll never know
where the treasure is buried.

887
01:14:58,238 --> 01:14:59,281
What treasure?

888
01:15:00,740 --> 01:15:02,325
The Treasure of Imawiener.

889
01:15:02,534 --> 01:15:03,618
I'm a wiener?

890
01:15:05,537 --> 01:15:06,538
Classic.

891
01:15:06,746 --> 01:15:08,915
Well, always leave them laughing.

892
01:15:09,124 --> 01:15:10,542
Goodbye, sir.

893
01:15:17,757 --> 01:15:22,512
Maggie! What a great little 
accident you turned out to be.

894
01:15:25,473 --> 01:15:28,268
Colin? Colin!

895
01:15:28,727 --> 01:15:31,521
Lisa? Colin's dead.

896
01:15:33,106 --> 01:15:35,233
But his last words were:

897
01:15:35,442 --> 01:15:41,072
"Milhouse, take care of Lisa.
Hold her hand."

898
01:15:43,867 --> 01:15:46,328
I got her all warmed up for you.

899
01:15:46,536 --> 01:15:48,830
Colin. Hi.

900
01:15:49,039 --> 01:15:51,166
- Hey, you wanna go ...?
- Clean up the lake?

901
01:15:51,374 --> 01:15:54,044
Well, I was gonna say
get some ice cream, but okay.

902
01:15:55,003 --> 01:15:56,796
I like ice cream.

903
01:16:03,136 --> 01:16:05,180
Kind of sweaty. Sorry.

904
01:16:20,028 --> 01:16:22,614
Boy! You survived! How?

905
01:16:22,822 --> 01:16:24,658
I did things no dog should do.

906
01:16:24,866 --> 01:16:26,826
They will haunt me forever.

907
01:16:27,285 --> 01:16:28,453
I love you too.

908
01:16:44,386 --> 01:16:47,013
Best kiss of my life.

909
01:16:47,222 --> 01:16:49,975
Best kiss of your life so far.

910
01:17:08,535 --> 01:17:09,744
Steady.

911
01:17:10,620 --> 01:17:12,956
Steady.

912
01:17:14,249 --> 01:17:16,418
Steady.

913
01:17:16,626 --> 01:17:18,044
Dad?

914
01:17:18,962 --> 01:17:20,714
Thanks, boy.

915
01:17:20,922 --> 01:17:23,383
Steady.

916
01:18:10,222 --> 01:18:13,141
They've taken everything, sir.

917
01:18:15,685 --> 01:18:19,439
Smithers, I don't believe in suicide ...

918
01:18:19,648 --> 01:18:23,193
but if you'd like to try it,
it might cheer me up to watch.

919
01:18:57,811 --> 01:18:59,062
This is Tom Hanks, saying:

920
01:18:59,271 --> 01:19:02,148
If you see me in person,
please, leave me be.

921
01:19:15,203 --> 01:19:18,999
Spider-Pig, Spider-Pig

922
01:19:19,541 --> 01:19:23,336
Does whatever a Spider-Pig does

923
01:19:23,753 --> 01:19:27,841
Can he swing from a web?

924
01:19:28,049 --> 01:19:31,344
No, he can 't, he's a pig

925
01:19:31,553 --> 01:19:32,846
Look out!

926
01:19:33,388 --> 01:19:37,100
He is a Spider-Pig

927
01:19:39,895 --> 01:19:41,187
Look out!

928
01:19:41,396 --> 01:19:45,567
He is a Spider-Pig

929
01:20:14,346 --> 01:20:18,308
Come on, Dad, let's go. I've been holding
it since they put the dome over the town.

930
01:20:18,516 --> 01:20:21,603
You can wait. A lot of people
worked really hard on this film ...

931
01:20:21,811 --> 01:20:25,941
and all they ask is for you
to memorize their names.

932
01:20:26,149 --> 01:20:28,568
Well, I wanna make sure
no animals were harmed ...

933
01:20:28,777 --> 01:20:31,738
during the filming of this movie.

934
01:20:35,492 --> 01:20:36,493
Okay.

935
01:20:37,369 --> 01:20:39,663
Floor popcorn.

936
01:20:41,748 --> 01:20:44,584
Wait, wait, wait! It looks like
Maggie has something to say.

937
01:20:44,793 --> 01:20:47,587
Oh, my God. Her first word.

938
01:20:48,338 --> 01:20:50,257
Sequel?

939
01:24:28,975 --> 01:24:32,354
Springfield doesn't have an anthem

940
01:24:32,562 --> 01:24:36,483
We thought we had one
But we don 't

941
01:24:36,691 --> 01:24:40,528
We paid a short guy to write it

942
01:24:40,737 --> 01:24:44,532
But we never saw him again

943
01:24:44,741 --> 01:24:48,536
The tune we stole from the French

944
01:24:48,745 --> 01:24:52,123
There's a few things they do well

945
01:24:52,332 --> 01:24:56,378
Like making love, wine and cheese

946
01:24:56,586 --> 01:25:00,549
Like Roqueforts, Camemberts and Bries

947
01:25:00,757 --> 01:25:04,553
Springfield, we're going to die

948
01:25:04,761 --> 01:25:09,516
Springfield, I'm scared, goodbye

949
01:26:20,295 --> 01:26:24,382
Assistant manager
isn't all it's cracked up to be.

950
01:26:30,305 --> 01:26:33,808
Four years of film school for this?
